## Instructions:
The tasks below try to simulate a real-life work flow as a frontend developer, focusing on using React as your major tool. Judgement will be made not solely on completion of the tasks, but also other factors such as: Knowledge of fundamental javascript concepts, code refactoring and optimization, use of best practices etc.

PLEASE NOTE: You're not to use any external libraries, other than the ones already provided.

Estimated completion time for tasks is about 4 hours. But I'm sure you can do it in less ;)

### Task 1 (JSON Search):
Write a simple utility function that searches through a JSON object / array using a given string query, and returns the appropriate value.
Reference: `/utils/utils.js`

### Task 2 (Client Side Filter):
Add functionality to the input field, such that any input provided, filters the available providers based on their Name, address or Type. 
Hint: The JSON search function you wrote earlier should come in handy here.
Reference: `/layouts/ExplorePage.jsx`

### Task 3 (Server Side Search):
Complete the AutoCompleteDropDown component. On input it should make a request to server to search through the provider list. The response should be rendered in the dropdown.
Reference: `/components/common/AutoCompleteDropDown.jsx`

### Task 4 (Form Submission)
Complete the NewProviderForm to allow creation of new Providers.
Reference:
`/components/NewProvider.jsx`
`/components/forms/NewProviderForm.jsx`

### Task 5 (View Provider)
Add functionality where necessary to navigate to a new route for viewing a selected provider.

### Task 6 (Redux)  
Lol. Just kidding. Thats all....for now :smiling_imp: .
Feel free to improve and optimize the codebase however you like. Ensure you mention whatever optimization you made in the submission mail though, along with the thought process behind it as well.

## Submission
Once done, upload your submission to your Github repo, and send an email to [tech@reliancehmo.com]().

Best of luck! :v:
